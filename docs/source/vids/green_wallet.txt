In this guide, we'll learn how to set up a Testnet hot wallet on your mobile device. The testnet is a separate network within the Bitcoin system specifically constructed for testing software without using real currency. Initially, getting Testnet Bitcoin might appear cumbersome, but everything will become much clearer once you have some.

Before we start searching for Testnet Bitcoin, we need to set up a hot wallet to hold them. Please install Green wallet by Blockstream on your mobile device from your app store.

Once you've installed Green wallet, navigate to the app settings. There, switch on the "Enable Testnet" option and save your settings.

You'll also need to accept the terms of service and privacy policy, so check those boxes. After doing that, click "add wallet". On the add wallet page, click "new wallet" and choose "testnet".

Next, reveal your recovery phrase by clicking on "show recovery phrase". Make sure to write down all 12 recovery words. As this is a testnet wallet, it's fine to store these on your computer because Testnet Bitcoin will never have any actual value.

As directed, retype your recovery words. Set up a PIN and hit 'continue'.

Click on 'create account' and then select "standard".

At this point, you've successfully created your wallet, and you're ready to start receiving Testnet Bitcoin.

To copy your Testnet wallet address to your clipboard, click on "receive", and then on the QR code.

We will use this copied address in the subsequent step to receive Testnet Bitcoin from faucets.
