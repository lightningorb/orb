We're pleased to announce that Orb is now fully FOSS, under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. We've had to clean up the repo of old files, so this is a new Repo: we've lost:

- issues
- pull requests

Since Orb targets many different platforms, the build system is **complex** to say the least. We'll spend some time getting the various builds working again.

We'll spend some time documenting every inch of this repo so everyone can contribute.
