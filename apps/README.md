These are the app store apps, not the apps that come installed by default.

You can also check out: 

- The [auto-rebalancer app](../orb/apps/auto_rebalance)
- The [auto-fees app](../orb/apps/auto_fees)
- The [auto max htlcs app](../orb/apps/auto_max_htlcs)

Please note a lot of these apps were written before CLN support. Therefor they may be written using the LND API rather than the Orb API that supports both CLN and LND.
